## Memory (AI Notes)

### Month 3, Mar 15
- **Pattern confirmed:** User calls before building = faster iteration. Built wrong thing twice when skipping calls.
- Hit 6 paying customers. Quote: "I can't believe people pay for this."
- Anxiety about money is fading. Focus shifting to retention.

### Month 2, Feb 20
- **Shipped ugly, got feedback.** First paid customer came from Twitter DM after seeing WIP screenshot.
- Quote: "I almost didn't post it because the UI was embarrassing."
- Note: Embarrassment is not a valid reason to delay.

### Month 2, Feb 8
- Avoided 3 user calls this week. Rescheduled twice, ghosted once.
- **Pattern:** When anxious about product, I hide in code instead of talking to users.
- Agent asked: "What are you afraid they'll say?" Answer: That it's not useful.

### Week 3, Jan 25
- Finally did first user call. She said the core feature is useful but the onboarding is confusing.
- Built onboarding fix in 2 hours. Should have called sooner.
- Quote: "I've been building what I imagine, not what they need."

### Week 1, Jan 10
- Started. MVP is 60% done. Keep adding features instead of shipping.
- **Bug identified:** Perfectionism disguised as "quality." Agent called it out.
- Set public deadline: launch in 2 weeks no matter what.`

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Month 3, Mar 15
- **First technical interview completed.** Didn't get it, but feedback was "strong fundamentals, need more system design."
- Not devastated like I thought I'd be. Learning experience.
- Adding system design study to daily routine.

### Month 2, Feb 22
- **Shipped portfolio project #2.** Actually solved my own problem (expense tracker).
- Got 12 stars on GitHub. Small but real validation.
- Quote: "This is the first thing I built that I actually use."

### Month 2, Feb 10
- **Pattern breaking:** Caught myself starting a new tutorial instead of finishing the project.
- Agent asked: "Is this learning or procrastination?" It was procrastination.
- Rule: No new tutorials until current project ships.

### Week 3, Jan 28
- Still in tutorial hell. Watched 8 hours of React videos, built nothing.
- **Agent observation:** "You've learned this concept 3 times. The gap isn't knowledge, it's doing."
- Committed to shipping something ugly by Sunday.

### Week 1, Jan 12
- Set goal: career change in 6 months.
- Overwhelmed by everything I "need" to learn.
- Agent helped narrow: JavaScript + React only for now. Depth over breadth.`

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Month 3, Mar 15
- **8 weeks consistent.** Longest streak ever. Something clicked.
- Audience engagement up 3x. People replying, sharing, DMing.
- Quote: "I stopped trying to be perfect and started trying to be useful."

### Month 2, Feb 25
- Batch filming is a game changer. Shot 4 videos in one day.
- Energy was high, quality was consistent, week is now stress-free.
- **Pattern:** Creating and editing in same session = burnout. Separate them.

### Month 2, Feb 12
- Missed posting for 5 days. Spiral started: "I already broke the streak, why bother."
- Agent: "Streaks are tools, not prisons. Post today."
- Posted something small. Felt better immediately.

### Week 3, Jan 30
- Spent 6 hours editing a 5-minute video. Perfectionism.
- **Agent observation:** "Your best-performing video was filmed on your phone in one take."
- Insight: Audience cares about value, not production quality.

### Week 1, Jan 14
- Starting fresh. Goal: post 3x/week for 3 months.
- Previous attempts died at week 2-3. Pattern: perfectionism → burnout → quit.
- Agent suggestion: Set a "good enough" bar before creating. Stick to it.`

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Month 3, Mar 15
- **First project deployed!** It's a simple todo app but it's LIVE. I made this.
- Shared on Twitter, got 3 likes. Doesn't matter. It's real.
- Imposter syndrome quieter today. Proof helps.

### Month 2, Feb 28
- **Breakthrough:** Stopped watching tutorials, started building.
- Got stuck on a bug for 2 hours. Solved it. Learned more than 10 tutorials.
- Quote: "The confusion IS the learning. Tutorials hide it."

### Month 2, Feb 15
- Feeling behind. Saw someone on Twitter who learned React in "2 weeks."
- Agent: "Comparison is theft. You're not them. Focus on your pace."
- Muted tech Twitter for a week. Helping.

### Week 3, Jan 28
- Analysis paralysis: Should I learn Python or JavaScript? React or Vue?
- **Agent cut through:** "Pick JavaScript + React. Decide in 10 seconds. Go."
- I picked. Relief. Now I can focus.

### Week 1, Jan 15
- Starting career change journey. Scared but excited.
- Goal: job in 6 months. Feels impossible.
- Agent: "6 months is 180 days. What can you do today?" Today I set up VS Code.`
