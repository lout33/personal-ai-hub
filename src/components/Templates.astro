## Identity
- **Name:** Alex Chen
- **Age:** 29
- **Location:** Austin, TX (CST)
- **Type:** ENTJ

## Mission

> "Build something people want, get to ramen profitability, then decide what's next."

1. Ship MVP and get 10 paying customers
2. Hit $5K MRR before runway runs out
3. Build in public, document the journey

## Stack

Next.js | Supabase | Stripe | Vercel

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Fear of going back to corporate, proving I can do this alone, freedom

**Bugs:**
1. Building features instead of talking to users
2. Perfectionism disguised as "quality"
3. Avoiding sales calls - hiding behind code
4. Scope creep - adding "just one more thing" before launch

**What works:**
- Public deadlines (tweet it, can't back out)
- User calls before building anything
- Ship ugly, iterate fast
- Morning deep work, afternoon calls/admin

**What doesn't work:**
- Working in isolation for weeks
- Waiting until it's "ready"
- Comparing to funded startups

---

## Decision Test

- Does this get me closer to 10 paying customers?
- Am I building or avoiding?
- Would I mass delete this code if users don't want it?

## Work Blocks

| Block | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Peak | 6am-10am | Building, deep work |
| Flow | 10am-2pm | User calls, content |
| Recovery | 2pm-6pm | Admin, planning |`

## Identity
- **Name:** Jordan Park
- **Age:** 27
- **Location:** Seattle, WA (PST)
- **Type:** INTP

## Mission

> "Level up technically, land a senior role at a company I respect, keep building on the side."

1. Get a senior developer role at a top tech company
2. Ship 2 side projects that solve my own problems
3. Contribute to open source I actually use

## Stack

TypeScript | React | Node.js | PostgreSQL | Docker

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Technical mastery, respect from peers, building things that work

**Bugs:**
1. Tutorial hell - learning without shipping
2. Over-engineering side projects (enterprise patterns for todo apps)
3. Imposter syndrome - feeling "not ready" for senior roles
4. Abandoning projects at 80% done

**What works:**
- Public commits (GitHub streak accountability)
- Ship first, refactor later
- Pair programming / code review
- Learning by building, not watching

**What doesn't work:**
- Endless courses without projects
- Waiting to "know enough" before applying
- Working alone without feedback

---

## Decision Test

- Does this project solve a real problem I have?
- Am I learning or procrastinating?
- Would I use this if someone else built it?

## Work Blocks

| Block | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Peak | 8pm-12am | Side projects, deep focus |
| Flow | Lunch break | Learning, reading |
| Recovery | Weekends | Open source, exploration |`

## Identity
- **Name:** Maya Rodriguez
- **Age:** 31
- **Location:** Miami, FL (EST)
- **Type:** ENFP

## Mission

> "Build an audience by sharing what I learn. Turn expertise into income without selling out."

1. Post consistently - 3x/week minimum
2. Grow to 10K followers on main platform
3. Launch first paid product (course/ebook/community)

## Stack

YouTube | Twitter/X | Notion | Descript | Canva

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Impact, creative expression, freedom from 9-5, being seen

**Bugs:**
1. Perfectionism - spending 10 hours on a 5-minute video
2. Comparison - paralyzed by what others are doing
3. Inconsistency - bursts of content then silence
4. Avoiding monetization - feels "icky" to sell

**What works:**
- Batch creation (film 4 videos in one day)
- Publishing schedule locked in calendar
- Engaging with community daily (15 min max)
- "Good enough" > perfect

**What doesn't work:**
- Editing while creating
- Checking analytics obsessively
- Waiting for inspiration
- Copying others' style instead of finding own voice

---

## Decision Test

- Does this serve my audience or just my ego?
- Would I make this if no one watched?
- Is this sustainable long-term?

## Work Blocks

| Block | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Peak | 9am-12pm | Creating, filming, writing |
| Flow | 2pm-5pm | Editing, scheduling |
| Recovery | Evening | Engaging, consuming content |`

    content: `# USER.md - Student Profile

## Identity
- **Name:** Sam Taylor
- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (CST)
- **Type:** ISFJ

## Mission

> "Career change into tech. Learn by building, not just studying. Get hired within 6 months."

1. Complete portfolio with 3 real projects
2. Land first developer job (junior is fine)
3. Build network in tech community

## Stack

Learning: Python | JavaScript | React | SQL

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Better career, proving I can change, financial stability

**Bugs:**
1. Tutorial addiction - watching instead of doing
2. Analysis paralysis - which language/framework to learn
3. Feeling behind - comparing to CS grads
4. Not shipping - afraid to show imperfect work

**What works:**
- Project-based learning (build first, learn concepts as needed)
- Study groups / accountability partners
- Sharing progress publicly (even if small)
- Time-boxing study sessions (2 hours max, then build)

**What doesn't work:**
- Trying to learn everything at once
- Waiting to "finish learning" before building
- Isolated studying without community
- Ignoring networking until job search

## Decision Test

- Does this get me closer to a portfolio project?
- Am I studying or procrastinating?
- Can I explain what I learned to someone else?
